# E-Commerce-AI-Capstone-Project
The objective is to perform sentimental analysis on E-commerce dataset of Amazon. Using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) the class imbalanced dataset is converted to class balanced. The project is successfully completed by predicting the sentimental analysis for the product reviews using algorithms like XGB classifier, Random Forest classifier, Support Vector Machines, Voting classifier, and Multilayer Perceptron. The Random forest classifier produced better accuracy score and F1-score than the other algorithms.
